[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ifricker/running_app.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/ifricker/running_app)

## Application Summary
Run from Routine.

Loopi is a web app created out of a desire to take the monotony out of running while also making it more efficient. Input a desired distance for your run and Loopi will find your location and generate a random route where the endpoint is where you started.

By using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, Loopi allows users to create a profile and save their favorite routes for future use. A focus on intuitive and responsive web design makes Loopi easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices, while the incorporation of Google Maps API provides users with accurate and customizable routes, as well as turn-by-turn directions. 

The first MVP of Loopi was completed in one week.
